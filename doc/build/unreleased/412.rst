    :tags: bug, lexer
    :tickets: 412

    Fixed long standing bug where the sequence ``<&`` would be misinterpreted
    by the lexer.   It's not clear why the ampersand character was part of the
    characters being consumed here and it may have been an inadvertent bit of
    code from one of Mako's predecessor languages.
